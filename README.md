# Konza_Fire_Sensors
These sensors will be used to monitor the temperature of a grassland fire using K-type thermocouples, Adafruit Adalogger, Adafruit ds3231 Featherwing, and MCP9600 i2c thermocouple amplifier.

The sensors will be inclosed in a fire resistant box or PCV pipe to protect it from the fire. Temperature within the enclosure will be monitored by both the MCP9600 cold junction and the ds3231 temperature sensor.

A red light will flash if the data was properly recorded on the SD card.
